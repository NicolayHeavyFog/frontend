`Over time, I comprehend new technologies and use them in a new projects.`

After that, I made a primitive one-page website on Grid - __High Photo__.

__CRM__ - the second my accomplished project, with backend. If you want to start the app, then you need to start through Node index.js in the SRM-backend directory. Hero I meet the MVC pattern and get that works.

* Pure js,
* BEM methodology (file structure - Flex),

After that, I continued learning and using new technologies including task runner as gulp and full-fledged module bundler as Webpack. Also, I met with code Linters (Prettier, Eslinters, Stylelint). Meanwhile, I found out about npm and how it works. After meeting Linters I collision Babel compiler. All the above I learned to adjust in one Webpack.

__seatDownPls__ - for the next project, from the start, I began bundling through the webpack, but soon I realized that webpack was more needed for a SPA and something like this than just a multi-page project, and I put in charge gulp along with linters. But in the gulp, I use webpack stream for js.
